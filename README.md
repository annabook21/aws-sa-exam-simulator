## üìã Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- All three files must be in the same directory:
  - `exam_simulator.html` - The main exam application
  - `exam_data.js` - The exam questions (JavaScript format)
  - `sa_exam.json` - The original exam questions (JSON format, for reference)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CORS Issue Solution

**Problem**: Browsers block loading JSON files when opening HTML files directly from your file system (`file://` protocol) due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) security policies.

**Solution**: The exam data has been converted to a JavaScript file (`exam_data.js`) which can be loaded without CORS restrictions. This file is automatically loaded when you open the HTML file.

## üöÄ How to Use

python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:8000/exam_simulator.html`

**Option 2 - Node.js (if installed):**
```bash
cd /Users/annabooker/Desktop/SA_exam
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:8000/exam_simulator.html`

**Option 3 - PHP (if installed):**
```bash
cd /Users/annabooker/Desktop/SA_exam
