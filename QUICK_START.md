# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

## What Just Happened?

You encountered a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error**. Here's what it means:

### The Problem ðŸ”´
When you open an HTML file directly from your computer (using `file://` protocol), modern browsers **block JavaScript from loading other local files** (like your `sa_exam.json`) for security reasons.

**The error you saw:**
```
Access to fetch at 'file:///.../sa_exam.json' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

This is a browser security feature, not a bug!

### The Solution âœ…
I've created `exam_data.js` - a JavaScript version of your exam questions that **can** be loaded by browsers without CORS restrictions.

## How to Use Right Now

### Simple Method (Just Works! âœ¨)
1. **Refresh** your browser (press F5 or Cmd+R)
2. You should now see the total number of questions loaded
3. Click **"Begin Exam"** to start!

**Required files (all in the same folder):**
- âœ… `exam_simulator.html` - The exam interface
- âœ… `exam_data.js` - The exam questions (JavaScript)
- âœ… `sa_exam.json` - Original data (kept for reference)

## Alternative: Run with a Local Server (For Advanced Users)

If you want to use the original JSON format or host this properly:

### Option 1: Python (Easiest)
```bash
cd /Users/annabooker/Desktop/SA_exam
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open: **http://localhost:8000/exam_simulator.html**

### Option 2: Node.js
```bash
cd /Users/annabooker/Desktop/SA_exam
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then open: **http://localhost:8000/exam_simulator.html**

## âœ… Verify It's Working

You should see:
- âœ… "Total Questions: 641" (or similar) on the welcome screen
- âœ… No error messages in the browser console
- âœ… "Begin Exam" button is clickable

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Configure your exam**: Choose number of questions and time limit
2. **Start practicing**: Click "Begin Exam"
3. **Simulate real conditions**: Try the 65-question, 130-minute full exam

## ðŸ“ž Still Having Issues?

1. **Check browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) for errors
2. **Verify all 3 files** are in `/Users/annabooker/Desktop/SA_exam`
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome is recommended)
4. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
