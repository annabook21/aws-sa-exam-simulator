# 🎯 Professional Exam Features - Research-Based Implementation

## 📚 Research Summary

Based on analyzing **CertExams**, **PearsonVUE OnVUE**, and professional testing platforms, I implemented these evidence-based features:

---

## ✅ Implemented Professional Features

### 1. **Study Mode vs Exam Mode** 
**Research Source:** CertExams, Professional Testing Software

**What it does:**
- **Study Mode:** See correct answers immediately after selecting (learning-focused)
- **Exam Mode:** No feedback until end (realistic test simulation)

**Why it matters:** Different learning styles need different feedback timing. Study mode = learning, Exam mode = assessment.

---

### 2. **Answer Elimination Tool (Strikethrough)** ⭐ MOST REQUESTED
**Research Source:** Test-taking best practices, Professional exam interfaces

**What it does:**
- Hover over any answer → Click **✕** button to cross it out
- Eliminated answers show struck-through and faded
- Click **✕** again to un-eliminate
- "Reset Eliminations" button clears all for current question

**Why it matters:** #1 test-taking strategy - eliminate obviously wrong answers first to improve odds.

---

### 3. **Scratch Notepad** 📝
**Research Source:** Real exam centers provide scratch paper/whiteboard

**What it does:**
- Click "📝 Notepad" to open floating notepad
- Persists throughout entire exam
- Use for calculations, notes, working through problems
- Draggable, resizable notepad window

**Why it matters:** Many AWS questions require working through scenarios - notepad simulates real scratch paper.

---

### 4. **Full Answer Explanations in Results**
**Research Source:** CertExams feedback system, Learning science

**What it does:**
- Shows complete text of your answer
- Shows complete text of correct answer
- Color-coded feedback (green = correct, red = incorrect)
- For multi-select: shows all correct answers

**Why it matters:** Can't learn from mistakes without seeing what was actually correct.
